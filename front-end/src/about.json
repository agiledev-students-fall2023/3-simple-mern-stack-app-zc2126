In my spare time, I tend to enjoy cooking as well as reading into foreign policy. From time to time I'll also try to work on a few coding projects here and there. More recently, I've managed to get into Warhammer 40k, with me still learning how to assemble and paint various minis -- the Ad Mech will be the death of me (if you know you know)."
